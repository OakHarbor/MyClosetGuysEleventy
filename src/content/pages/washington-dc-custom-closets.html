                My Closet Guys helps home and multi-family housing owners in the Greater Washington DC area save space, increase their quality of life, and add tremendous value to their properties with custom closet design and installation. Whether you need to outfit your walk-in closet with a new storage system or build a reach-in closet for daily use, please get in touch.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Experience and Integrity Set us Apart</h2>
            <h3>Each Closet Is Meticulously Designed</h3>
            <p>
                We don’t mass-fabricate our closet components, and we don’t sell closet systems in bulk. We will speak with you about your needs, measure the height and width of your closet, present trims, colors, and wood options in our initial meeting, and set to work creating a fully custom space for you. We then create a 3D rendering of your new closet before we start to build the shelves, drawers, and other aspects.
            </p>
            <h3>We Provide a Lifetime Warranty</h3>
            <p>
                From tools to wood materials and hardware, the quality of our products are top-notch. We build each closet system with care, and we never anticipate a customer calling us with problems. However, if you do encounter a deficiency in your closet system components, you may call us and we will fix it right away. Common issues with other closet providers may include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Poor measurements resulting in gaps, warped boards, and swing or sliding doors that don’t function properly</li>
                <li>Split shelving because of overly-tightened screws, poor wood quality, and more</li>
                <li>Hinges, sliders, bars, and other pieces of hardware that were lazily installed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You won’t have those issues when you hire My Closet Guys - and we guarantee the quality of your storage system.
            </p>
            <h3>We Have Four Decades of Experience</h3>
            <p>
                There are not many custom closet installers in Washington DC who can claim 40+ years of commitment to the job, but we are proud to be among the few who can. We’ve built large walk-in closets, garage storage systems, custom pantries, linen closets, and so much more. We know what materials and styles work best for every need, and we would love to share our experience with you.
            </p>
            <h2>Courteous and Responsive Closet Builders From Design to Installation</h2>
            <p>
                The design phase of our closet projects are collaborative and even fun – we take all of your feedback into consideration. We are happy to make as many suggestions as you feel necessary, but this closet is ultimately to increase your quality of life. We won’t start fabricating materials until you have signed off on the 3D rendering.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes time for installation, we will give you an accurate timeline to plan on. When we arrive, we’ll treat your home with respect by covering furniture and carpets, protecting your plants, and avoiding any valuables. We work quickly - our closet installations rarely take more than a day.
            </p>
            <h2>We Maintain The Original Character of Your Home</h2>
            <p>
                Whether you live in a beautiful Victorian townhouse or brownstone on Swann Street NW, we can show you various trims and accents that will work seamlessly with the timeless nature of your house. We understand that you don’t want to diminish your home’s value by creating an add-on that doesn’t assimilate with the rest of your home’s interior.
            </p>
            <p>
                Or if you own a contemporary condo, loft or penthouse, we can create a sleek and efficient custom closet system that will preserve the open feel of your home while providing additional storage. We have also done a great amount of work with large colonials and traditional homes in Bethesda, Chevy Chase, and other suburbs. Regardless of the square footage or architectural style, your new closet design will fit right in and increase your home’s value.
            </p>
            <h2>Custom Closets in Washington DC Designed For Your Lifestyle</h2>
            <h3>Closets For the Shoe Aficionado</h3>
            <p>
                Whether you need easier access to your collection of Sarah Flint pumps or would like to showcase your Bruno Magli dress shoes, we can design and build a spectacular shoe organizer for your closet.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, glass-fronted cabinets are a stylish way to store and display your shoes. They allow you to see your entire collection at a glance, while keeping your shoes protected and dust-free.
            </p>
            <p>
                Or we can create floating shelves for your custom closet – they are a sleek and modern option for shoe storage, and we can mount them on the wall at any height, allowing you to create a custom display that shows off your shoes. If you're short on space, a shoe storage ottoman can be a great option. These ottomans have a hidden compartment inside that allows you to store your shoes out of sight, while providing a comfortable place to sit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, we can create any kind of custom slanted shoe shelves, cubbies, or other storage options for you. Just tell us what you are looking for!
            </p>
            <h3>Custom Closet Design For the Power Suit Collector</h3>
            <p>
                If you would like to showcase your suits, access them more easily as you prepare for meetings or a day at the office, and keep them safe from moths and dust, we can design a custom closet system for you. Wood selection weighs into the equation, and we can also add space for ties, shoes, shirts, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cedar is a popular choice for suit storage, as its natural oils and scent act as a repellent for moths and other insects. Cedar also helps absorb moisture, which can prevent mold and mildew from developing on your suits. Another option is sandalwood, which has similar insect-repellent properties to cedar and also gives off a pleasant aroma. Additionally, mahogany is a durable and strong wood that can provide excellent protection for your suits. No matter which type of wood you choose, it's important to keep your suits in a cool, dry place to prevent damage and extend their lifespan.
            </p>
            <h3>Practical Storage For All of Your Accouterments</h3>
            <p>
                We often receive requests for custom and lockable jewelry drawers, pull-out tie racks, watch storage systems, and more. We would love to discuss your particular lifestyle considerations with you and design a jaw-dropping closet system specifically for you! Our closets look stunning, have tremendous practical impact on your daily life, and improve the value of your home.
            </p>
            <h2>Serving All Neighborhoods in Greater Washington DC</h2>

Even the most luxurious homes in Georgetown are often limited by square footage, and we would be happy to work our magic and create more open space for you.
            </p>
            <h3>Custom Closets in Logan Circle</h3>
            <p>
                Logan Circle has become one of the more densely populated neighborhoods in DC, and we can always help create custom shelving or closet systems for 1, 2, and three bedroom apartments. We also work with HOAs and property managers to create build-wide systems in multi-family housing units - get in touch for more information.
            </p>
            <h3>Closet Design in Foggy Bottom, Adams Morgan, and More</h3>
            <p>
                If you give us a call or send an email, our closet designers will schedule a meeting with you at your home or property. We’ll bring material samples for your review, and we’ll carefully measure the space we will be working with.
            </p>
            <h2>Walk-In Closet Design in DC</h2>

                We’ve created and installed countless walk-in closets for in-law suits, master bedroom suites, and more, and whether we are dealing with 60 square feet or 200, we can create an oasis for you and your clothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are happy to design an all-inclusive closet with storage space shirts, dresses, suits, shoes, valuables (including a safe), hangers, cubbies and more. We also receive requests for shelving with benches underneath – common for those putting on their shoes in a walk-in closet. We can also incorporate things like a custom closet island, ottomans, and so much more.
            </p>
            <h2>Reach-In and Linen Closet Design</h2>
            <p>
                Not every closet must be palatial and luxurious. We’ve helped hundreds of homeowners make better use of their space by installing hallway closet systems, bathroom closets, and much more. We can build out the shelving to facility towel, linen, blanket, and other storage needs, and we can also create a perfect system for your laundry. Tell us about your situation, and we’ll create the perfect system for you.
