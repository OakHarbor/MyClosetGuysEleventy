            <h1 class="cs-title">Custom Cabinets in McLean: Kitchen Cabinet Design and More</h1>
            <p>The layout, quality and look of your cabinet system influences your entire lifestyle. Whether it's your kitchen, your garage, or the back hallway you pass through every morning, you need beautiful and elevated cabinets that are fit specifically for your home.</p>
            <p>We build custom cabinet systems for homes in and around McLean. Each project begins with a free in-home consultation. We take exact measurements, talk through your needs, and create a 3D design so you can see the results before we start building. Once the layout and materials are finalized, we install the cabinet system with careful attention to fit and function. To schedule your consultation, call <a class="cs-link" href="tel:3013325254">(301) 332-5254</a>.</p>
            <h2>Thoughtfully Designed for the Way You Live</h2>
            <p>We approach each project with a fresh set of eyes. In one home, the kitchen may need deeper drawers and better lighting. In another, the garage might need cabinets tall enough for bins and outdoor gear. We look at what's missing and build a system that gives structure to the space.</p>
            <p>Nothing we install comes from a box store or template. Everything is cut to fit your room exactly. There are no awkward filler panels or gaps. Every shelf, drawer, and pullout is placed with purpose.</p>
            <p>You'll meet with a designer who visits the space, brings samples, and walks you through material and layout options. Then we produce a detailed 3D rendering. You'll be able to see the cabinet layout, finishes, and hardware before anything is fabricated. This is your chance to make adjustments and ask questions. You won't have to guess what the final result will look like.</p>
            <h2>Materials and Finishes That Match Your Home's Character</h2>
            <p>Cabinets are a permanent visual element in most rooms. The wrong tone or material stands out. We offer a full range of wood and engineered options, including maple, oak, birch, painted MDF, and durable laminates. We bring samples to your home so you can see how each finish looks in the actual light and setting.</p>
            <p>Some clients prefer flat panel doors with brushed hardware and a clean profile. Others request traditional cabinet fronts with soft edges and a warm wood stain. We'll help you select hardware that complements your layout, whether you prefer matte black pulls, brass knobs, or a finish that blends into the background.</p>
            <h2>Better Performance Than Standard Cabinets</h2>
            <p>Mass-produced cabinet systems often include particle board, low-grade slides, and hardware that wears out too quickly. They're made to cover space, not to fit it.</p>
            <p>We take the opposite approach. Every system is built in our shop using stronger materials and tighter cuts. Doors hang correctly. Drawers slide without sticking. Everything lines up and feels solid. We don't try to adapt stock cabinets to your space. We build the system to match your home's layout and dimensions from the start.</p>
            <h2>Clean, Professional Installation</h2>
            <p>Installation usually takes one day. We arrive with the full system pre-assembled and ready to install. Our crew handles everything from aligning cabinet doors to securing wall units to verifying that every piece functions as designed. We double-check the final fit and walk through the details with you before finishing up. The workspace is left clean, with no debris or leftover packaging.</p>
            <h2>Cabinet Solutions for Every Room</h2>
            <p>We build cabinets for kitchens, garages, laundry rooms, mudrooms, offices, and other areas where storage needs to be both functional and attractive.</p>
            <p>Kitchens often benefit from deep drawers, pull-out trays, vertical dividers, and built-in trash compartments. In garages, we add cabinets that mount off the floor, along with overhead compartments and workbench storage. Laundry rooms are usually designed with upper cabinets, fold-down surfaces, and spaces to sort or store items out of sight.</p>
            <p>Many homes also need custom cabinetry in less obvious places. We install dry bars with glass shelving, hallway linen storage, home office built-ins, and decorative shelving for family rooms and dens.</p>
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Custom Cabinets</h2>
            <h3>What's included in the consultation?</h3>
            <p>We come to your home to take measurements, bring material samples, and talk through the layout and use of the space. From there, we build a full 3D rendering of your cabinet system and provide a quote.</p>
            <h3>Can you match existing cabinets or trim?</h3>
            <p>Yes. We can match the general style, wood type, or paint color of existing cabinetry or architectural features. This is especially helpful in homes with built-in millwork or custom baseboards.</p>
            <h3>Do I get to choose the hardware?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. We'll walk through your options for knobs, pulls, hinges, and drawer slides. You can select everything from finish to shape, and we'll bring samples to help you decide.</p>
            <h3>What types of cabinets do you build?</h3>
            <p>We build full systems for kitchens, garages, bathrooms, laundry rooms, and other storage areas. We also build single-wall storage, full-height pantries, and custom shelving units.</p>
            <h3>How long does the process take?</h3>
            <p>Most designs are finalized within one to two weeks. Once the design is approved, we build the cabinets in our shop and return for installation, typically within two to three weeks depending on the size of the project.</p>
            <h3>Where do you provide service?</h3>
            <p>We serve homes throughout McLean as well as nearby areas including Great Falls, Tysons, Langley, and Vienna. If you're located just outside Fairfax County, feel free to contact us---we're happy to confirm whether we can come to your home.</p>
