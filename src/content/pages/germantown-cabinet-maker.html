                <h2>Custom Kitchen Cabinets in Germantown Homes</h2>
                <h3>We Think About Layouts, Function and Design</h3>
                <p>You need the right balance between drawer depth, vertical space, and accessibility. We'll discuss layout adjustments, including how to group drawers and doors based on your routines. A prep zone may need pull-out trash and compost bins below the counter. A baking area might benefit from tray dividers, soft-close rollout shelves, or vertical pull-outs for cooling racks.</p>
                <p>Corner spaces can be made usable with kidney-shaped shelves or swiveling hardware that rotates fully out. We also offer upgrades like appliance garages, concealed lighting under cabinets, hidden charging drawers, and toe-kick storage that hides in plain sight.</p>
                <h3>Cabinet Construction and Material Options</h3>
                <p>Our cabinets are often built to size using solid plywood boxes with edge banding, not particle board or thin composite stock. You'll be able to select from a range of finishes including painted hardwood fronts, thermally fused laminate (TFL), and veneer panels. Paint-grade maple is a popular choice for clean white finishes, while oak, walnut, and cherry offer natural texture. We can also discuss all natural maple, oak, or other types of wood.</p>
                <p>Hardware options include European concealed hinges, under-mount soft-close drawer slides, and full-extension glides. We'll walk through all of it during your consultation, with samples on hand to compare colors, textures, and durability.</p>
                <h2>Durable Garage Cabinet Systems</h2>
                <h3>Heavy-Duty Storage</h3>
                <p>Garage storage should hold more than just paint cans. Our garage cabinet systems can be anchored to walls or freestanding depending on your space. We use high-strength melamine, powder-coated metal, and sealed plywood that won't chip or absorb moisture. Shelving and cabinets are reinforced to hold heavier tools, automotive supplies, and oversized gear.</p>
                <p>We also offer integrated workbenches, vertical lockers for yard equipment, and pegboard panels for tool storage. Everything is cut to size and installed to avoid wasted floor space.</p>
                <h3>Wall-Mounted, Floor-Based, or Hybrid Systems</h3>
                <p>Some garages work better with a floating setup that keeps the floor clear. Others need deep base cabinets that double as support for a work surface. We'll look at how your garage is used and help determine the best structure for your needs. All drawers and doors come with high-use hardware designed for frequent, sometimes rougher handling.</p>
                <h2>Other Areas We Transform with Custom Cabinets</h2>
                <h3>Laundry Rooms and Mudrooms</h3>
                <p>Cabinetry in the laundry room or mudroom helps cut down on clutter and creates order around daily tasks. We install tall cabinets for cleaning supplies, upper cabinets over washer-dryer units, and bench systems with cubbies or drawers below. Soft-close hardware, moisture-resistant materials, and easy-clean surfaces come standard in these spaces.</p>
                <h3>Home Offices and Living Rooms</h3>
                <p>Cabinet systems in home offices can include drawer bases with file hangers, upper cabinets for tech storage, and even full wall units with pull-out desks. For living rooms or libraries, we can design open shelving with built-in cabinets below to hide cords and electronics while still displaying books or art.</p>
                <h2>Serving Germantown and Surrounding Communities</h2>
                <p>We regularly design and install custom cabinets in Germantown neighborhoods near Wisteria Drive, Middlebrook Road, and Seneca Valley. Our team also serves the surrounding area, including Gaithersburg, Clarksburg, North Potomac, and Montgomery Village.</p>
                <p>Every project begins with a free in-home consultation. We'll take precise measurements, offer guidance on materials and layouts, and provide a 3D rendering of your proposed design. There's no obligation, and we offer a price match guarantee in many cases.</p>
                <h2>Why Homeowners Choose My Closet Guys</h2>
