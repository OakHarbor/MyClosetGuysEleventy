<h2>Types of Storage Solutions For Your Garage</h2>
<h3>Garage Cabinets in Northern VA and Washington DC</h3>
<p>Our custom garage cabinets are made with high-quality materials, reinforced with strong hardware, and can withstand the heavy-duty usage typical in garages. Whether you need to store circular saws, bowling balls, or beach furniture, our cabinets will stand the test of time. Our cabinets can be tailored to your specific needs, with options including lockable doors for safe storage, adjustable shelving for versatility, and a variety of finishes to match your garage's aesthetic. Drawers can be added for smaller tools and hardware, ensuring every item has its place.</p>
<h3>Garage Shelving in NOVA and DC</h3>
<p>Our garage shelves can be wall-mounted or freestanding, depending on your preferences and the layout of your garage. We can include adjustable height as well; these shelves cater to a range of storage needs, from large boxes to gardening tools. All said and done, we want the shelving to fit your exact needs. We are also the finest <a href="/arlington-custom-closets">closet builders in Arlington</a>, and our shelving expertise shines through in our garage storage projects.</p>
<h3>Storage Chests</h3>
<p>Our custom garage chests can be built into your existing workspace, fitted to serve as a bench when closed, outfitted with locks, and segmented so that you have designated space for different tools and items. We can also create free-standing chests with wheels.Â </p>
<h3>Overhead Storage Solutions For Your Garage</h3>
<p>If you'd like ceiling-mounted shelving or storage units, we can help you free up wall and floor space. We will take weight into consideration, and we will want to get an idea of what you plan to store in the hanging organizers.</p>
<p>From garage wall organizers to custom work benches and bike racks, we want to turn your garage into a well-kept space that you can enjoy.</p>
