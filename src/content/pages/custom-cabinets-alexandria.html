                <h1 class="cs-title">The Finest Custom Kitchen Cabinets In Alexandria</h1>
                <p>My Closet Guys has decades of experience helping homeowners in NOVA with custom storage solutions, and we would love to speak with you. From custom kitchen cabinets in Alexandria to custom home office build-outs, garage storage, mudrooms and home libraries, we are happy to help. We'll discuss your needs, create a free quote for your review, then proceed with the included 3D rendering of the system before we start building.</p>
                <p>Every board is carefully cut and fitted in our shop, and we pay as much attention to the installation of your cabinets as we do to fabricating them. From a colonial-inspired kitchen cabinet system to contemporary bathroom cabinets, we are here to improve your quality of life.</p>
                <h2>Our Kitchen Cabinets are Durable and Functional</h2>
                <p>If you want your cabinet system to last for decades, avoid the cheap particleboard and one-size-fits-all approach that big box stores take. Saving a little bit of money now (which is not even guaranteed!) is not worth it in the long run.</p>
                <p>Cheap cabinets will crack, warp, and sag, and in particularly unfortunate cases, they may fall out of the wall entirely.</p>
                <p>Firstly, we measure your kitchen, garage, mudroom, or other space in great detail. We want to create a system that will be aligned with studs in the wall and your appliances, and we always create a perfect fit in our shop. Then we use high quality medium density fiberboard (MDF) -- this material is safe, workable to create a perfect fit, warp-free, and will last for decades. We also use professional hardware to hold it all together. We are committed to creating cabinet systems that will function well for many years to come.</p>
                <h2>Choose Your Kitchen Cabinet Style</h2>
                <p>As expert woodworkers, we can create a unique cabinet system that specifically meets your design goals and functional needs. Here are just a few options -- although we can make something for you that's fully custom as well.</p>
                <h3>Classic Shaker Cabinets</h3>
                <p>Everyone loves Shaker cabinets, and they always look great in historic areas like Alexandria. Shaker cabinets feature a recessed panel door, and you can add these cabinets in both traditional and modern kitchens. Many homeowners prefer a clean white look with their Shaker cabinets, although eggshell white and soft gray work as well. You can even go with navy blue, dark greens, or espresso paint - that's up to you.</p>
                <h3>Modern Slab Cabinets</h3>
                <p>Slab cabinets have flat, smooth doors without frames or panels, and they look great with high-gloss lacquer, matte neutrals, or natural wood grains. Slab cabinets look particularly good in contemporary kitchens -- stainless steel appliances, granite tiles, and other modern-looking features will pair well with slab cabinets. We are more than happy to send pictures.</p>
                <h3>Rustic or Farmhouse Cabinet Styles</h3>
                <p>Contemporary farmhouses are all the rage, and rustic designs will never go out of style. They will typically feature oak, pine, or reclaimed barnwood, and these will show off the organic beauty of knots, grains, and imperfections. Weathered edges, hand-scraped surfaces, or antiqued stainsÂ  also add the rustic nature of the cabinets. We can also replicate a rustic or farmhouse look with more industry-standard materials so that we can precisely cut and build the system.</p>
                <p>Here are some others features we can talk about if you would like a farmhouse cabinet system:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>
                <p>Beadboard panels</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Open shelving</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Apron-front sinks</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Sage green or other earthy colors</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Glass-front doors with mullions</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                <p>Vintage pulls or wrought iron accents</p>
                </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Raised Panel Cabinets in Alexandria</h3>
                <p>These cabinets feature a raised center panel that is framed by molding or beveled edges. This adds a depth and dimension to your cabinets that can't be replicated by other styles. Ask us about decorative elements like crown molding, corbels, or other woodworking, and we can even create curved or arched panels on the doors. It's a great opportunity to take your home to a new level.</p>
                <h2>Custom Garage Cabinets, Libraries, Offices and More</h2>
                <p>There are few sections of your house that wouldn't benefit from a custom cabinet system.</p>
                <p>The kitchen is an obvious place to put new cabinets. We can revolutionize your cooking process, wine storage, pots and pan organization, and more, and we can also create a new pantry system for you. We can work with a traditional, shaker, farmhouse, rustic, or other design aesthetic that compliments your kitchen.</p>
                <p>Bathrooms are another great place for custom cabinets. We can make your small bathroom more efficient, or your large bathroom more luxurious -- from custom closets to shelving and cabinets, let us improve your quality of life.</p>
                <p>We also build out many custom cabinet systems in garages and mudrooms. These semi-finished spaces often become overrun with clutter like boots, coats, dog toys, sports equipment, tools, and who knows what else -- but you can fix that. We'll assess the space and build out a perfect cabinet system for you. In the garage, we can install metal shelving and cabinets, or we can keep it rustic with genuine wood. The choice is yours.</p>
