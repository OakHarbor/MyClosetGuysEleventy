            <p>My Closet Guys has 40+ years of experience creating amazing storage solutions in Maryland, and we would love to help you organize and upgrade your garage. We can help you build out a custom workshop area, arrange items and tools with custom garage cabinets and shelving, and remove clutter with chests and other built-ins. Please give us a call for your free consultation. We would love to hear from you.</p>
            <h2>You'll Love Working With My Closet Guys</h2>
            <p>Our experience and craftsmanship shine through with every project. After our initial phone call, we'll schedule a complimentary design consultation at the job site. We will discuss your needs, get a feel for your aesthetic preferences, show your material samples if you'd like, and take measurements. We will also want to know what you plan on storing -- we may need to take weight into consideration.</p>
            <p>We will then create a 3D mockup of the project for you to approve. Only after we've hammered out the details will you receive a quote from us. Once you've signed the quote, we'll start building the storage components in our workshop.</p>
            <p>The installation is about as simple as it gets. Everything is custom cut and measured in our workshop, so we can usually install your garage storage system and be out of your way within a few hours.</p>
            <p>From your first interaction with us until we finish the project, we are committed to a friendly, knowledgeable, and collaborative experience for our clients.</p>
            <h2>Custom Garage Storage Design and Layout</h2>
            <h3>Built For Your Specific Needs</h3>
            <p>Do your kids leave their bicycles all over the garage? Do you need a storage system for paint, auto mechanic tools, golf equipment, or anything else? We take your lifestyle and specific needs into account. That's the best part of a custom garage storage system in Maryland - you don't need to choose from pre-fabricated designs that may or may not suit your needs.</p>
            <h3>Adjustable Garage Storage Systems</h3>
            <p>We can build your storage system so that it can adjust as your needs change or your family grows. We would like to discuss this with you in our initial consultation, and we can create cabinets, shelving, chests, and more that can be added to or adjusted over time.</p>
            <h3>Durable and Ready To Work Hard</h3>
            <p>Garage storage is a unique discipline in that we will take the use-case and load-bearing needs into account while selecting materials. Depending on how you choose to use your storage system, we may need stronger materials, added bracing, and more -- we want to build you the most durable and reliable storage unit possible.</p>
            <h2>Specific Solutions</h2>
            <h3>Garage Cabinets in Maryland</h3>
            <p>We're also known as the leading <a href="/maryland-custom-closets">custom closet installers in Maryland</a>, and we carry our cabinetry expertise over to our garage projects. We can help you store boots, tools, toys, gardening equipment, pet supplies and more in attractive, minimalist garage cabinets. These cabinets can be floor-based or anchored to the wall (depending on materials and structure), and we can work with you to arrive at the best layout and select your preferred materials.</p>
            <h3>Garage Shelving in Maryland</h3>
            <p>From attractive floating shelves to full-wall shelving units, let us turn your garage into an oasis of organization and order. You'll know where everything is at all times, have lots of open floor space, and increase the resale value of your home.</p>
            <h3>Storage Chests For Your Garage</h3>
            <p>Whether you need chests that double as benches, want to secure valuable tools and belongings in locked storage, or include built-in tool chests in a custom workspace, let us know.</p>
            <h2>Areas We Serve in Maryland</h2>
            <p>We serve Anne Arundel County, Prince George's County, Calvert County, St. Mary's, and more.
