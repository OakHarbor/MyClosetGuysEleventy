                <p>From kitchen cabinets to garage storage and home office solutions, My Closet Guys builds the best custom cabinets in Annapolis and all of Anne Arundel County. We work with our clients on budget, design, finishes, and we even provide a 3D rendering for you to approve before we start fabricating your cabinet system.</p>
                <p>Everything is fully customized, and we intend for your new cabinets to last for decades. Not only does a custom cabinet system improve your home value -- it improves your quality of life. Prepare food more efficiently, declutter your home, and find tools and files whenever you need them.</p>

                <h2>Forget Big Box Store Cabinet Systems</h2>
                <p>You can do better than a prefab cabinet system. The first issue with prefab systems is durability. Most are made with extremely cheap materials like particleboard or plywood, and these can warp, crack, and sag after just a few years. The hardware holding the system together matters as well -- cheap screws and hinges lead to the untimely demise of many cabinets. You should also take the installation into account, and not just because of looks! It can be dangerous to have a cheap cabinet system on your wall. Installing cabinets is an art form unto itself, and it needs to be executed perfectly.</p>
                <h3>Our Custom Cabinets in Annapolis Stand the Test of Time</h3>
                <p>We use high quality materials, like industry standard medium density fiberboard (MDF), for our cabinet systems, and we also select high quality hardware, handles and fixtures. You won't see chips, warps, or other issues. We also have decades of experience with home installations, and we would never leave until we are certain that your cabinets are safe and secure (and that your wall can safely handle the weight).</p>
                <h3>Careful Planning and Measurements Add to the Quality</h3>
                <p>It goes beyond the materials. We measure your space in great detail, and we take the time to fabricate a perfect fit in our shop. The fact that the cabinets will fit together, and in your space, perfectly, alleviates any concern about structural integrity. We use industry-leading lasers and cutting tools to fabricate our systems, and our installations go very quickly because the materials are built for your space.</p>
                <h3>Improve Your Quality of Life</h3>
                <p>Only you know where you like to keep your Le Creuset, utensils, spices, files, shoes, tools, or other household items. A custom cabinet maker will create a system suited to your specific lifestyle.</p>
                <p>Cooking will be easier and more pleasant, your work-from-home days will be more productive, and your garage will be less cluttered than ever. You'll wonder why you didn't invest in custom cabinets before!</p>
