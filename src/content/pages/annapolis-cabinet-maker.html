            <p>My Closet Guys doesn't only make exquisite custom closets, we also make beautiful custom cabinets. We work with you to design the perfect cabinets to fit your kitchen, bathroom, garage, or mudroom. We create a 3D image of the designs to show you exactly what we have in mind.

            <h2>Custom Cabinets For Every Space</h2>
            <p>Installing new cabinets is a great way to add storage space, optimize your room space, and even increase property value. But installing cabinets is not an easy task. You should not start a project like this without proper consultation, planning, and expertise. Luckily, our painters bring over 40 years of experience, detailed plans and strategies, and a transparent quoting process to the table so you can rest assured that the job will be done well. </p>
            <h3>Kitchen Cabinets</h3>
            <p>Top-notch cabinets are quintessential for a good kitchen. Kitchen cabinets give a sense of cleanliness. They offer a feeling of structure. They give off an air of belonging in the kitchen.</p>
            <p>Good kitchen cabinets can be an expression of style as much as anything. The kitchen is one of the most personal rooms in the house, so why not add a personal touch? Our contractors work hard to create and deliver the best possible custom cabinets to fit your needs and desires. With a wide variety of woods to choose from, you are sure to find the perfect fitting style for your kitchen. You can choose from materials such as oak, maple, or cherry. You can even personalize the finish on the wood like stained, painted, or glazed. </p>
            <h3>Custom Bathroom Cabinets</h3>
            <p>Installing cabinets in the bathroom is a great way to maximize usable space and declutter. From a small bathroom vanity to a large master bathroom in  great need for storage, our contractors will create the perfect storage space for you. We can do all the work from installing the pantry in the kitchen to installing the closet in the bathroom. After we install the closet, we can outfit the closet to your exact specifications, making it a space you feel comfortable with. On top of outfitting the new closet, we can furnish the bathroom as well. Adding new fixtures and hardware to perfectly accommodate your taste.</p>
            <p>When building and installing these new furnishings, our contractors will use special woods like moisture-resistant composites, the perfect fit for the bathroom. </p>
            <h3>Pantries, Garages, Mudrooms, and More</h3>
            <p>Installing cabinets in pantries, garages, and mudrooms is a simple way to improve the everyday quality of life. Cabinets help clear space while adding to the style and aesthetic of the house.</p>
            <p>Adding cabinets to useful spaces such as pantries only increases the efficiency of a naturally busy room. When working in the kitchen, the pantry gets a lot of traffic, and having all the necessary appliances strategically stored away will help you keep track of all your possessions.  To further maximize your space, we can add cabinets with pull-out drawers.</p>
            <p>Garages benefit greatly from cabinets. Custom cabinets offer a place to store tools, gardening equipment, automotive supplies, and more. Cabinets of this degree will most likely be made out of a more robust and strong wood. The strength and durability of our wood does not sacrifice our craftsmanship. Our contractors always deliver the best cabinets, no matter the style.</p>
            <p>Mudrooms benefit from cabinets by offering storage for coats, shoes, and other outdoor gear, helping to keep the rest of the house clean and organized. Additionally, cabinets in mudrooms can include features such as built-in benches or cubbies, further enhancing their functionality.</p>
