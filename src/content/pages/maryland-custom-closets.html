            <p>My Closet Guys, Maryland's premier contractor for custom closets and storage, improves homeowners' quality of life with amazing designs every day. We create walk-in closets, reach-in closets, custom storage for laundry rooms, and so much more.</p>
            <p>For more information about our services, or if you would like a free consultation, please get in touch! We would be happy to hear from you.</p>
            <h2>What is it Like to Hire My Closet Guys?</h2>
            <h3>Our Initial Phone Call</h3>
            <p>Whether you need a walk-in closet for your master bedroom, a linen closet in the hallway, or closets for an apartment building you manage, we would love to chat with you. We'll ask about your goals, your aesthetic preferences, any accessibility concerns, and frustrations you have with your current storage, and more. We treat closet projects as collaborations with the client, and our intention is for you to enjoy the whole process.</p>
            <h3>We Visit The Job Site</h3>
            <p>Our expert closet designers will visit your home and take detailed measurements. We need to know the square footage of the closet location, the ceiling height, the location of studs and outlets, and more. We will also present material samples so you can decide on finishes, trims, and colors.</p>
            <h3>We Design a 3D Rendering</h3>
            <p>We use cutting edge 3D visualization tools to design the exact look of your new closet. Once designed, we will send you this 3D rendering, and you are more than welcome to provide feedback. You can still change the colors, trim, doors, seating, and more at this point of the project.</p>
            <h3>We Build and Install Your Custom Closet</h3>
            <p>Once you have approved the mockup of the closet, we get to work in our shop. We perfectly cut and measure each board based on our initial visit to your home -- we want each part of your closet system to fit perfectly and last for a lifetime. When we arrive at your home to install the custom closet, we'll cover your carpet, furniture, and protect your walls. Most of our installations are completed in one day.</p>
            <h2>High End Closet Design That Reflects Your Style</h2>
            <h3>Modern Closet Systems</h3>
            <p>If you live in a home with contemporary architecture, you may want an ultra-modern closet system. Consider an ash wood finish to create a soothing and refined look, complete with geometric lines and more. We can also install glass doors to complete the hyper-modern look, and whether you want to complete the space with black leather or closet island with a glass top, we are happy to oblige.</p>
            <p>Of course, you don't need to use an ash finish to look modern. From miter doors with brass knobs to aluminum drawers, we can create a unique look for you.</p>
            <h3>Stately and Traditional Closet Designs in Maryland</h3>
            <p>If your home errs on the side of colonial, tudor, or other architectural aesthetics, we can help you install a breathtaking closet system that fits right in. From shaker cabinets to trim and crown molding, your closet will significantly elevate your home. We can also use pine, cedar, maple, and other wood finishes, and we will accommodate upholstery, carpet, leather, and more.</p>
            <p>In our initial consultation, let us know if you are angling towards a contemporary or classic closet -- and if you don't know, we are happy to make suggestions.</p>
            <h2>We Promise Quality in Every Detail</h2>
            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <p>Many closet designers rely on cheap sliders, hinges, dividers, rivets, and other pieces of hardware that hold your closet together. We offer a lifetime warranty on our closets, and the individual components of your organization system will be as durable as the more visible elements of the closet. Your doors will continue to function well for many years to come, the knobs and handles won't become loose, and you can rely on your closet to function perfectly.</p>
            <h3>The Wood Itself</h3>
            <p>Our doors, shelving, and seating are fabricated from high end materials. We don't want your shelves to split or warp over time, and we can also consult with you on the temperature and humidity levels that you should look for in your closet area. We can also take requests for specific kinds of wood on your trims and finishes.</p>
            <h3>Experienced Closet Installation Experts</h3>
            <p>Not only do the design and materials need to be high quality, but the installation process needs to be done with integrity as well. We carefully measure and fit each board in our workshop, so when we build the closet in your home, each component fits and functions properly. This process is also very quick (usually in less than a day), because of the prep work that happens beforehand.</p>
            <p>We use high quality tools, and we've been installing closets for 40+ years. So you run no risk of shoddy workmanship on your custom closet.</p>
            <h2>Fully Customized: Finishes, Closet Doors, Functions and more</h2>
            <h3>Closets Designed For Any Function</h3>
            <p>Many of our clients want a dedicated space to store, display, and put on their shoes. Whether you have heels, dress shoes, or an Air Jordan collection, we can install sloped shelving for easy viewing, a glass display, and built-in seating for easy dressing.</p>
            <p>Other clients wish to display or lock their watches, jewelry, and other valuables in their closet. We can create a custom sliding drawer system that locks, or even a locked glass top display. We have also installed safes in our closet systems.</p>
            <p>Of course, we can always accommodate wardrobe features for formal wear, business attire, and casual clothing. We pride ourselves in building beautiful and uplifting closets that function exactly as your lifestyle dictates.</p>
