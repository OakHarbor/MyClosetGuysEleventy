                    <h3>Insured Contractors With 40+ Years of Experience</h3>
                    <p>
                        We’ve been building custom closets, pantries, garage storage and more for over forty years, and we’ve made hundreds of homeowners happy along the way. There is no space or home design that we can’t handle. Furthermore, we’ve learned that each closet installation is a unique experience - we don’t take a cookie-cutter approach to your home. You can trust our experience and work ethic to create an amazing storage space for you.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Lifetime Warranty</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our materials, machinery, and techniques are industry-leading, and for that reason, we are comfortable providing a lifetime warranty on our work. We never expect our customers to call us about a defect in their custom closet, but should they feel the need, we’ll make it right as soon as humanly possible.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Courteous Contractors + Headache-Free Service</h3>
                    <p>
                        An in-home closet build may feel like an invasive process. We’re sensitive to the fact that we are in your home, and we go to great lengths to make sure you are comfortable. We are courteous and friendly, and we make sure to cover any carpets, appliances, or other furniture that may be at risk while we work on your closet space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, we stick to our time frames and install your closet as quickly as possible (while adhering to our quality standards). We don’t want to be in your home for longer than a day if there’s no pressing need.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Rigorous Design Process</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your custom closet starts with a careful design phase. We don’t want to build something that you don’t think is amazing! We will visit your home, measure the space in great detail, apply your desires and feedback, and present you with a 3D rendering of the closet or storage unit. Only after every detail has been decided upon will we proceed with the fabrication of your closet.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Excellent Cost Value</h3>
                    <p>
                        At My Closet Guys, we actually do the work. Because we fulfill our closets in-house, we are able to provide reasonable, streamlined pricing to our clients. No markups for sub-contractors means more affordable pricing for you. Additionally, we do offer financing to our customers.
                    </p>
