            <h2>Working With My Closet Guys</h2>
            <h3>We Review Your Email or Chat on the Phone</h3>
            <p>When you fill out or form or call us, you can always expect a quick response and a friendly, helpful conversation.
                We'd love to hear about your goals, storage problems, and dream solution, and we'll speak with you about your
                options and how we can help. Feel free to tell us exactly what you want, or leave all of the creative work up to us!
            </p>
            <h3>The Free Design Consultation</h3>
            <p>Firstly, we'll schedule a time for our design consultant to visit your home. They will carefully measure the space
                and ceiling height, and we'll identify studs, electrical outlets, and other considerations. We will also present
                color and material samples, and we will make recommendations while we are there. This is a great time to help us
                understand your vision for the storage space, if you have something in mind.</p>
            <h3>Your Free 3D Rendering of the Closet</h3>
            <p>We take our measurements and notes back to our workshop and design a 3D rendering of your closet. These models show
                you exactly how the finished product will look in your home, and you are more than welcome to provide feedback and
                ask for updated versions. You don't pay a cent until we have agreed on the design and you've reviewed our free
                quote.</p>
            <h3>We Fabricate Your Custom Closet Perfectly</h3>
            <p>Once we know we're on the same page, we start to fabricate shelves, benches, and other closet elements in our
                workshop. We have state of the art tools and laser-guided cutting machines, and we create each individual component
                of your closet to exact specifications. This ensures a perfect fit when we install the closet, a quick installation
                process, and a closet that will stand the test of time.</p>
            <h3>Quick Installation in Your Home</h3>
            <p>Once the pre-fabrication process is complete, we'll schedule an installation time at your home in the Germantown
                area. Nearly all of our projects are installed in less than a day, and we always respect your privacy while working
                in your home. We use drop cloths, protect your walls and furniture, and always clean up after ourselves. We also
                test all of the nuts, bolts and other hardway before we leave.</p>
            <h3>Lifetime Warranty on Your Custom Closet</h3>
            <p>We are experts at what we do, and we stand by the quality of our materials, design and tools. That enables us to
                offer a lifetime warranty on our closets. If you start to notice sticky doors or warped boards (which we don't
                expect), please give us a call and we'll address it as soon as possible.</p>
            <h3>Hard-To-Beat Pricing</h3>
            <p>Fully customized closets can be expensive, but we are able to keep costs lower than our competitors. That's because
                we have a small team of experienced experts, and we handle everything, from design to fabrication and installation,
                in-house. Without outsourced costs, we are able to deliver stunning and high quality closets at a lower cost than
                other providers. Furthermore, you aren't picking a closet out of an online catalog -- the product is fully designed
                and customized for you.</p>
            <h2>All Closet Styles in Germantown, MD</h2>
            <p>From walk-in closets in the Milestone neighborhood of Germantown to linen closets and built-ins in Fountain Hills,
                we've helped countless homeowners with better storage solutions.</p>
            <p>Do you have a bathroom or hallway that needs some storage? We can help you allocate space for a reach-in closet that
                will improve your daily lifestyle. We can focus the closet on clothing, towels, shoes, housewares and more, and it
                will be fully customized for you. We will also work with you to allocate the storage spaces in a manner that is
                suitable for your height and access needs.</p>
            <p>We also love building walk-in closets in Germantown. Convert a small room into a luxurious walk-in closet, apportion
                part of your bedroom and more -- we can work with you to visualize and build a life changing closet space for you.
            </p>
            <h2>We Offer High End Closet Finishes</h2>
            <p>As the leading <a href="/maryland-custom-closets">custom closet contractors in Maryland</a>,
                we are experienced with luxury, high end, and ultra-high end closets in addition to more budget-friendly options. If
                you'd like to use natural materials, consider walnut, cherry, or oak for either the shelving or accents. It has a
                more dramatic look than other finishes, and we have the skills to use it. Or consider leather accents and handles --
                leather drawer pulls or leather built-in benches are always an option.</p>
            <p>We can also incorporate glass and metal in your custom closet. Glass-fronted storage cubbies for shoes, brass handles
                and knobs, and more can be included.</p>
            <p>As far as custom storage is concerned, we can include slanted shelving for shoes, rotating motorized tie racks,
                floating shelves for hats, and even built-in safes for valuables. Pull-out drawers for watches and other jewelry may
                also be an excellent idea.</p>
            <p>Of course, some of the finest closets include luxurious closet islands. We can fabricate and install an island that
                has seating, a luxury countertop, pull--out drawers, and more.</p>
