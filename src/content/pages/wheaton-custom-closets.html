            <p>We've installed walk-in closets, linen closets and other solutions for countless clients in and around Wheaton, MD,
                and we would love to help you. From charming bungalows in Kensington to stately townhomes near Wheaton Regional
                Park, we've improved all kinds of homes with custom storage installations. Please get in touch for your free design
                consultation at your earliest convenience.</p>
            <h2>Maryland-Based Pros With 40+ Years of Experience</h2>
            <p>Experience matters in the closet-building industry. We use high quality materials, fabricate our shelving with
                perfect precision, and help homeowners design beautiful, uplifting, and practical spaces. We also know how to
                utilize every square inch of your designated closet space. We won't leave dead corners that you can't use, we know
                how to install adjustable shelving that caters towards your evolving needs, and we plan the space vertically to
                maximize your storage.</p>
            <p>We can also design closets suited to a number of design preferences. Do you love crown molding and wainscoting? We
                can fabricate stunning trims for you. Or do you want a hyper-modern closet with geometric cuts, matte paneling and
                sleek glass finishes? We can present materials that will work for you as well.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we believe in our craftsmanship so much that we offer a lifetime warranty on our closets. We don't anticipate
                any problems, but whether you see bowing shelves or broken drawer handles, give us a call and we'll fix it.</p>
            <h2>Our Custom Closet Process</h2>
            <p>First, you can expect a friendly chat where we understand your designated closet space, your design preferences, your
                use case (children's closet? Master bedroom walk-in closet? Linen closet?), and gather any other useful bits of
                information.</p>
            <p>After that, our design professional will visit your home and take measurements. We will understand the depth, width
                and height of your space, and we'll show you potential colors, materials, and finishes. We would also love to learn
                more about your vision for the closet. If you aren't sure, that's fine as well -- we can guide the design process.
            </p>
            <p>Next, we will mock up a 3D model of your future closet for your review. This step is still complimentary, and you can
                send us feedback for us to work into the model. Only after you've approved the mockup and design will we send you a
                quote.</p>
            <p>After you've reviewed and approved our quote, we'll take the fabrication process to our workshop. We custom cut every
                board, drawer, and shelf, and we use state-of-the-art tools to measure with great precision. This allows us to
                quickly install the closet system in your home and be out of your hair as quickly as possible.</p>
            <h2>Luxurious Walk-Ins and Practical Reach-In Closets in Wheaton</h2>
            <h3>Your Dream Walk-In Closet</h3>
            <p>From large walk-in closets to efficient spaces carved out of a corner in your bedroom, we can design your dream
                walk-in closet. In larger spaces, we can work with seating areas, built-in benches, closet islands, and more. In
                smaller walk-in closets, we'll capitalize on your space by vertically stacking shelving, cubbies and cabinets, and
                you'll be amazed at how much storage you can get out of so little space.</p>
            <p>We can also include many high end finishes like glass-fronted display cases, soft-close pull-out drawers for jewelry,
                display shelving for shoes, and much more. From dark wood-grain finishes to economical built-ins, we'd love to help.
            </p>
            <h3>Efficient Reach-In Closets</h3>
            <p>Hallways, bathroom closets, custom reach-in pantries, and utility closets in your garage are all within our realm of
                expertise. We will maximize your closet space, whether we have 14 or 36 inches of depth to work with. We can also
                build custom shelving for a variety of use-cases, including towels, laundry bins, toiletries, clothing and much
                more.</p>
