<p>We build custom wine racks and storage systems for clients in the Washington DC area, and we would love to help you showcase and organize your bottle collection. From wall-mounted vertical wine racks in your kitchen to spare room conversions and wine cellar build-outs, please get in touch. We offer a free design consultation to all interested parties, and we always send a 3D design proposal before writing a formal quote. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<h2>Different Wine Storage Solutions</h2>
<h3>Wine Racks For Kitchens, Dining Rooms and Entertainment Areas</h3>
<p>Perhaps you need easy access to your wines while entertaining, or maybe you enjoy hosting wine tastings in your home. Whatever the case may be, we can help. We can design and build tongue and groove paneling wine racks, peg &amp; panel storage systems, floating wine shelving for your dining room, and so much more. We can also install free-standing wine storage systems if you would like to allocate some floorspace to your collection. Wine drawers are always an option as well.</p>
<h3>Convert a Room or Closet Into Wine Storage</h3>
<p>We are known for our <a href="/arlington-custom-closets">custom closets in Arlington</a> and all of the DC area, but we also create wine rooms out of unused closet space. We can turn small reach-in closets into amazing wine spaces by tastefully building out shelving and vertical wine racks, and we can even allocate space at the bottom of the wine rack for a beer fridge or wine cooler, if you need to chill sparkling wines and other varieties. If you have enough space for a walk-in wine room, we can craft custom built-ins for the walls, floor-anchored wine cabinets built around a sink or refrigerator, and custom countertops for bottle opening and more. We can also install custom stemware racks that you can easily access.</p>
<p>Choose from rustic designs that include reclaimed wood and metal, or opt for a traditional wine rack design with Shaker influences, beaded cabinet styles, or flat-panel cabinets. We can also create a sleek and modern wine storage system for you, if it suits the aesthetic of your home.</p>
<h2>Custom Wine Racks in Washington DC For Collections of Different Sizes and Varieties</h2>
<p>Whether you have 100 bottles on hand or 2,000, we can design a custom system for you. We can build out shelving in a pre-existing cellar or work with any space you have at home. We can organize your collection by variety, alphabetically, by year, and more, and we will make sure that bottles are stored in perfect horizontal fashion to keep the corks moist.</p>
<p>Designing a luxurious custom wine storage system requires thoughtful planning and consideration. We'll start by assessing your wine collection size and types. Climate-controlled cabinets or racks are essential for storing high-value or aging wines. For high end storage systems, materials should evoke luxury---think mahogany or walnut for wood, or stainless steel for a modern touch. LED lighting can highlight your collection, while glass-fronted cabinets can showcase prized bottles. Don't forget space for accessories like wine openers and glasses. We can also include a seating area for tastings or simply enjoying a glass of wine. Comfortable chairs, a small table, and soft lighting can create a welcoming atmosphere in this luxury wine sanctuary.</p>
