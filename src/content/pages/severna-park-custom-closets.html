                Call the closet design and installation experts at My Closet Guys for a fully customized and breathtaking closet. We’ve been helping homeowners in Severna Park and throughout Maryland for over 40 years, and we would love to speak with you about your project.
            </p>
            <p>
                We provide free quotes to anyone who is considering a custom closet, and our work comes with a lifetime warranty. Please get in touch to start the conversation.
            </p>
            <h2>Why Work With My Closet Guys?</h2>
            <p>
                As an insured and experienced closet design company based in Maryland, we take every closet, garage storage unit, custom office, and other project seriously. We provide a lifetime warranty on our work, and that’s because our methods and materials are proven to stand the test of time. You will love your custom closet, guaranteed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When you call us, we will have a friendly conversation about your needs and preferences. What kind of wood or other materials do you like? How do you see yourself using your closet? Do you have any custom considerations? After our chat, we will schedule a time to visit the space, take measurements, and present sample materials.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we enter the design phase. We will create a 3D model of the closet for you to approve, and we won’t start fabricating the modules until you love what you see.
            </p>
            <p>
                After we’ve agreed on the design, we set to work constructing the components in our shop. We will organize everything, cut each board perfectly, and have the closet ready to install. We’ll arrive at your home at a predetermined time and install your closet quickly, usually in a day.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are courteous and respectful of our customers, and our goal is to make every aspect of the design process fun and collaborative. 
            </p>
            <h2>From Practical Closets To Luxurious Walk-In Spaces, We’ve Done It All</h2>
            <p>
                You might need to refurbish your hallway or linen closet, or you might want to upgrade your master bedroom with the closet of your dreams. Whatever the case may be, we’ve done it before.
            </p>
            <h3>Walk-In Closet Installation in Severna Park, MD</h3>
            <p>
                We can design compact or expansive walk-in closets, and we are always happy to work your specific goals into the project. Do you want a dressing table in the middle, or perhaps a closet island? We can build the perfect solution with cabinets, shelving, and a beautiful countertop included. We can also add space for an ottoman, or build benches into the side of your closet.
            </p>
            <p>
                We often receive requests for slanted shoe shelving, space for hat collections, or locked pull out displays for watches and jewelry. We can utilize every square inch of the closet space, from open shelving near the bottom to wall-length mirrors and custom safes.
            </p>
            <h3>Linen and Reach-In Closet Design in Severna Park, MD</h3>
            <p>
                Not every home needs a huge walk-in closet, and sometimes our expertise is needed the most to organize small spaces. We can reimagine your bedroom or bathroom closets, and you’ll be amazed at how much more space you have.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can create space for towels, laundry, shoes, suits, and so much more, and it would look as good as it functions.
            </p>
            <h2>We Can Work With Your Favorite Wood
            </h2>
            <p>
                Many of our customers prefer to use plywood for their custom closet because of its versatility and cost-effectiveness. We can make plywood look beautiful, and load-bearing is not usually an issue because we can reinforce your shelving.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if you want a higher-end look and feel, we can also use various types of natural wood. Pine is a readily-available option, and it adds a nice smell to your closet. The same applies to cedar, another popular wood for closets and accents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do consider the fact that natural wood may split or bend if the humidity levels fluctuate in your closet. If you think this might be the case, speak with us about building your custom closet out of plywood with reinforcements or another popular material, melamine.
            </p>
            <p>
                That said, we do not need to use one single material for the whole system. We can create a cedar space for your wool clothes, and construct the rest out of a different material, for instance. Just let us know what your preference is, and we are always happy to make suggestions.
            </p>
