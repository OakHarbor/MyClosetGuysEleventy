            <p>My Closet Guys builds unique, practical, and durable closet systems for homeowners in Northern Virginia. Whether you need a luxurious walk-in closet, a garage storage system, or a custom linen closet, give us a call for your free consultation. We help clients all throughout NOVA, including Fairfax, Fredericksburg, Manassas, Alexandria and more.</p>
            <h2>A Fun and Easy Closet Design Process</h2>
            <h3>We Will Discuss Your Goals and Preferences in Detail</h3>
            <p>Do you want to move your wardrobe into a walk-in closet? Do you have an extensive shoe collection that deserves custom shelving with a bench? Do you want to protect your suits from moths and the elements with an enclosed cedar cabinet? Whatever your specific needs may be, we'll make your custom closet work for you. We can also provide insight regarding specific features that our past customers have loved.</p>
            <h3>We Visit Your Home and Take Measurements</h3>
            <p>The next step is for our expert closet designers in Northern VA to visit your home, take measurements of the space in question, measure the ceiling height, and locate studs, electrical outlets and more. This helps us give you an accurate quote and build the closet system perfectly the first time.</p>
            <h3>We Provide a 3D Rendering of Your Custom Closet</h3>
            <p>We want our customers to be 100% satisfied with their new closet, so we send you a 3D visualization of the new system before we install the closet in your home. At this point, you can make suggestions, point out issues, and more. We are always happy to include your feedback in our designs.</p>
            <h2>Considerations When Building Your Custom Closet in Northern Virginia</h2>
            <h3>Your Wardrobe: Current and Future</h3>
            <p>Don't risk outgrowing your custom closet in the near future. Take into consideration your shoes, suits, dresses, jewelry, watches, bedding, and anything else that you would like to have easy access to. Take a look around your bedroom - what clutter would be resolved by a closet system built specifically for you? We can install angled shoe shelves, locked watch drawers, a beautiful jewelry display, and so much more.</p>
            <h3>Functionality and Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Do you want to have a luxurious space to get dressed each morning? We can create comfortable bench seating (or leave room for chairs). Furthermore, we can maximize space by building storage above and below the seating areas.</p>
            <p>Some of our clients enjoy having a closet island, sometimes complete with built-in seating and/or drawers. Mirrors, lighting, and accessibility for elderly or wheelchair bound folks are all things we can discuss in our consultation.</p>
            <h3>The Impact of the Closet on your Home's Resale Value</h3>
            <p>If the property is going to be your home for the long haul, resale value probably isn't your primary consideration. But if you might be moving in a few years, consider the impact of the custom closet on future buyers.</p>
            <p>That said, walk-in closets, custom built-ins, or linen closets can only increase your home's resale value.</p>
            <h2>High Quality Finishes, Materials, and Hardware</h2>
            <h3>Beautiful, Luxurious Finish Options</h3>
            <p>You may already have opinions regarding trim and finishes on your new closet. If so, we are happy to work those into your 3D rendering. If you aren't sure, we can help.</p>
            <p>We can install trim molding, a beautiful custom door, shaker cabinetry, brass clothing racks(or other colors), crown molding, and so much more. We can also create different effects with color; white for a bright space, dark wood for a classic luxurious feel, or a gender neutral closet for your children. From arts-and-crafts inspired closets with barn doors to more traditional setups, we can help.</p>
            <h3>High Quality Wood and Shelving</h3>
            <p>Common issues we see with custom closets include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Cabinet doors that stop closing correctly after a period of time because they weren't measured correctly<p>Cabinet doors that stop closing correctly after a period of time because they weren't measured correctly</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sliding drawers with hitches or other problems
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shelving that bows and bends over time because of humidity
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We have decades of experience, and we use high quality wood that won't wear down quickly. We can also use a variety of wood for trims and finishes: pine, oak, cedar, and more can be in the mix.</p>
            <h3>We Pay Attention to the Hardware</h3>
            <p>We pride ourselves on quality and craftsmanship, and that includes the literal nuts and bolts. We use high end tools, so the screws, nails, and fasteners won't loosen any time soon. And whether we use brass handles or wooden knobs, we choose durable parts that will last for many years. This also includes the hardware in drawers, folding benches, and more.</p>
