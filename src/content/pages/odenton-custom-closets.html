            <h2>You’ll Love Working With My Closet Guys LLC</h2>
            <h3>The Initial Consultation and Design Phase</h3>
            <p>
                When you call or email us, we will discuss  your goals and vision for your custom closet in detail. We would love to know what kind of space we will be working with, what kinds of materials you like, and what items you want to store in the closet.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that, we will schedule a design consultation. This is our opportunity to see the space and measure the square footage and height of the closet area. We will also discuss materials (we can bring samples as well), and we’ll start designing the layout. You will be able to see and sign off on a 3D representation of your custom closet before we start building it in our workshop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have approved the design, we’ll start fitting the boards and various components of your custom closet to your desired specifications.
