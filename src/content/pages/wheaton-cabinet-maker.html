                <p>Many homes in Wheaton are historic or custom, and that can make it tricky to find the right big-box-store cabinet system. We would argue that custom cabinets are worth the investment in any home, but we've found that certain types of homes deserve the right high end cabinetry to an even greater extent. Older kitchens and tight garage layouts make it difficult to stay organized with standard cabinet sizes. My Closet Guys builds custom cabinet systems that work with your floorplan and reflect how you actually use the space.</p>
                <p>We take measurements during an in-home consultation, help you select materials and layouts, and provide a detailed 3D rendering before anything is built. From the first visit to final installation, we manage every step directly and make sure the finished result works well from day one. Call us or fill out our form for a free design consultation. We'd love to speak with you.</p>
                <h2>Custom Kitchen Cabinets With More Options and Better Materials</h2>
                <h3>Practical Layouts</h3>
                <p>Kitchen storage needs to be efficient---not just attractive. We plan cabinet groupings around how you move through the room and what you store most. For some clients in Wheaton, that means switching from double-door lowers to deep drawers that hold cookware and small appliances. Others prefer pantry-style cabinets with rollout trays, vertical dividers for baking sheets, or tray pull-outs for oils and spices.</p>
                <p>We also design around problem areas like corners, using options such as swiveling inserts, swing-out trays, or blind-corner drawers that give you access without wasted space.</p>
                <h3>Finishing and Construction Options</h3>
                <p>Cabinet boxes are usually built from furniture-grade plywood with thick edge banding for durability. We can review other material options like thermally fused laminate (TFL), natural wood veneer, or high-gloss acrylic, depending on your style goals and budget.</p>
                <p>For fronts and drawers, we offer paint-grade maple, stained oak or cherry, slab doors, or Shaker profiles. You'll be able to compare styles and finishes during the design meeting, using real samples, not printed catalogs. Our hardware selections include soft-close hinges, undermount slides, and full-extension drawer glides that perform well for years without adjustment.</p>
                <h2>Cabinets That Transform the Garage</h2>
                <h3>Built for Heavy Loads and Rougher Use</h3>
                <p>Garage storage often has to handle weight, moisture, and daily wear. We use thicker materials and sealed surfaces to hold tools, yard equipment, and bins without sagging or warping. Our cabinets can be mounted to the wall or installed with toe-kick bases to rest on the floor.</p>
                <p>We can include wide drawers for tools, lockers for tall items, and open shelving for gear that doesn't belong behind closed doors. If you need a work surface, we'll build that into the plan with enough clearance for storage underneath and space above for lighting or pegboard.</p>
                <h3>Wall-Mounted, Freestanding, or Mixed Systems</h3>
                <p>Some garages in Wheaton work best with a floating cabinet system that keeps the floor open. Others benefit from deep base cabinets that act as both storage and a built-in workbench. We help decide what fits the layout best by walking through how you use the space now and what's missing. Cabinet sizes, shelving heights, and door swing directions are all customized to fit your preferences.</p>
                <h2>Laundry Rooms, Mudrooms, and Built-Ins</h2>
                <h3>Organized Utility Spaces</h3>
                <p>We build cabinets for laundry rooms that hold detergents, folding supplies, and even built-in hampers. In tighter areas, we design tall storage to make use of vertical space or install open cubbies for easy access. Mudrooms often benefit from a cabinet-and-bench combination, which we tailor to your family's routines and available wall space.</p>
                <h3>Custom Offices and Media Wall Cabinetry</h3>
                <p>In home offices or dens, we install low cabinets with file drawers, upper units with closed storage, and shelving for books and displays. For family rooms or libraries, we can design an entire wall system with space for a television, built-in speakers, and cord management that keeps everything hidden but accessible.</p>
                <p>Each design is measured to fit the wall and includes finish options that match existing trim or contrast for a more modern look.</p>
                <h2>Serving Wheaton and Surrounding Communities</h2>
                <p>We complete cabinet projects across Wheaton, including homes near Georgia Avenue, Glenallan Avenue, and Viers Mill Road. We also work throughout Kensington, Forest Glen, Glenmont, and parts of Silver Spring. Each installation is handled by our team, not passed off to a third-party contractor.</p>
                <p>If you're ready to explore ideas, we'll bring samples, take measurements, and walk you through available layouts and materials. The consultation and design rendering are both free, and we'll also let you know if your project qualifies for our price match guarantee.</p>
                <h2>What to Expect When You Hire My Closet Guys</h2>
                <p>We've spent more than 40 years designing and building cabinets that solve problems in real homes. Every job we take on includes design support, project coordination, and hands-on installation. That means you won't have to juggle contractors or keep track of multiple vendors. We manage everything.</p>
                <p>Cabinets are built locally to your specifications, and you'll approve the full layout before we begin fabrication. We also offer financing options and warranty coverage on both the product and installation. From layout decisions to the last adjustment on site, we stay involved from start to finish.</p>
