            <p>Call My Closet Guys for custom bars, wine racks, built-ins, and other home or commercial woodworking. We have 40+ years of experience building custom solutions, and we would love to help you create your ideal space at home. We offer free design consultations, and we are happy to work with you to perfect every detail. We typically build custom bars in Maryland, Northern VA, and Washington DC. </p>
<h2>What's The Custom Bar Process?</h2>
<h3>Our Initial Consultation</h3>
<p>Perhaps you've been planning to build a custom bar for a while, or maybe this is a recent development or part of a new basement finishing plan. All you have to do is give us a call. We'll listen to your ideas, provide suggestions for wood trims, finishes, built-ins and more, and get an idea for your budget. We are happy to answer any questions you have about the process.</p>
<h3>The Custom Design Process</h3>
<p>Each home or restaurant bar is unique. You may need a sleek contemporary bar with metal accents and geometric trim, or perhaps you're looking for a rustic bar with rough-hewn wood accents for your country retreat home. From custom wet bars to outdoor tiki bar spaces, we are happy to help.</p>
<p>We will visit the job site, take measurements, and provide material samples and ideas for your review. We will finalize and input or specific requests you have at this time as well. We'll want to know things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are you an avid whiskey collector who needs a bottle presentation built into the bar?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you a mixologist who needs access to various glasses and stemware?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you need wine racks or anything else?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then we'll take our notes and measurements back to the design studio. We will mock up a 3D design of the bar, send it to you for approval, and work your feedback into the model.</p>
<h3>Custom Bar Installation and Fabrication</h3>
<p>Our shop in Waldorf is equipped with high end tools and resources, and we measure and cut each board to perfection. We custom fabricate each custom bar, so you aren't getting the same off-the-shelf design as other clients. Each piece of your bar will be sturdy, beautiful, and long lasting.</p>
<p>The installation process usually takes no more than a day, since we have fabricated the pieces at our workshop. We'll arrange a time to visit your home or restaurant, cover surrounding carpets, falls, or furniture, install the bar, perform a final quality check on the hardware and features, and we'll be out of your way. </p>
<h2>Choose From Many Styles and Bar Uses, Both Home and Commercial</h2>
<p>From a classic wet bar in your living room to a full bar in your &quot;man cave&quot; or party barn, we can work with you to craft and install your dream space.</p>
<p>You can never go wrong with a classic, traditional bar. We can incorporate dark wood tones, columns with half-round reed molding, brass knobs, and plush barstools. We can also help you find reclaimed wood and stone for a rustic lodge feel in your custom bar. If you want a modern, sleek design, we can create a wonderful bar out of composite materials, geometric angles, and even aluminum plates. We can also explore tiki, speakeasy, and other design angles. We love to flex our creative muscles and work with you to build an exceptional bar.</p>
<p>Of course, not every home bar needs a seating area. We can create a wonderful built-in in your home entertaining area (either surrounding a sink or not), and add displays for top-shelf beverages, a wine rank, space for a beer fridge, and more.</p>
<h2>Interesting Custom Bar Amenities</h2>
<p>Kick things up a notch with consideration for other luxurious home bar amenities. We can work with these, in addition to many others:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>TV built-ins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refrigerator built-ins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keg built-ins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stemware racks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Built-in pool cue holders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And so much more</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, we want to fully customize the bar to meet your specific needs.</p>
