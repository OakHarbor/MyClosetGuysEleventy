            <h2>What Makes My Closet Guys Different?</h2>
            <h3>Insured Contractors With 40+ Years of Experience</h3>
            <p>
                As contractors with over four decades of industry experience, we’ve seen it all - we know that we can design and install the perfect closet for you. We are fully insured, and we have hundreds of happy clients through Anne Arundel County and Maryland as a whole. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, we are proud to offer lifetime warranties on our work. We use high quality woods, hardware, tools, and methods, and we stand behind the lasting durability of our closets and storage systems.
            </p>
            <h3>We Treat You and Your Home With Respect</h3>
            <p>
                As custom closet builders who frequently work in people’s homes, we understand the invasive nature of the business. We are committed to making the experience as comfortable for you as possible. We will protect furniture, wallpaper, plants, carpets, and flooring, and we are always friendly and respectful at your home. We also stick to our promised time frames and wrap projects up in a timely manner so you can continue life as usual.
            </p>
            <h3>Great Prices and Quality Through In-House Work</h3>
            <p>
                We fulfill our own projects at My Closet Guys, and because we don’t outsource, we are able to deliver better work and better prices than many other closet designers in Crofton. We design, fabricate, and install your closet, and we have full control over the quality of your storage space.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Closet Design and Installation Process</h2>
            <h3>What To Expect When You Call or Email Us</h3>
            <p>
                When you get in touch, you can expect a friendly chat with one of the owners about your closet or other project. We’ll ask questions about the size of the space, the goals you have for your new closet, and perhaps the materials you’d like to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will then schedule a visit. We will measure the space and bring sample materials, and we’ll gather all of the information we need to start designing your custom closet.
            </p>
            <h3>Your Free Quote</h3>
            <p>
                We will then send you a free and personalized quote for the project that includes materials, costs, and labor. At this point, you are more than welcome to ask us questions about the cost, time frame, or anything else. We value customer service and communication.
            </p>
            <h3>We Design Before Building</h3>
            <p>
                You will be able to view a full 3D model of your closet before we start to build the modules and cut the wood. We want you to be happy with the design, material selection, and space allocation before we proceed - we can always make adjustments to the layout during this phase of the project.
            </p>
            <h3>Building and Installing Your Closet</h3>
            <p>
                Once you are excited about the design of your closet, we’ll start cutting the boards and building. We use high quality materials and professional tools, and we make sure everything is cut well and will fit perfectly. This keeps sliding shelves and other things functioning perfectly. Our installation process is quick and painless - we are often in and out of your home within a day.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also welcome any feedback our customers have after the installation is done. We want you to be happy with your custom closet, and we’ll make sure things are done right every time.
            </p>
            <h2>The Benefits of Our Custom Closets in Crofton, MD</h2>
            <p>
                Firstly, a custom closet system designed and installed by experts will help you maximize every square foot of your home. It’s a worthwhile investment, because your shoes, clothes, jewelry and more will no longer clutter your bedroom or other closets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondly, your closet will reflect your taste, style and personality. We can customize hardwood, plywood, MDF, and other materials for you, and we are more than happy to add paneling and other accents. Do you want a large mirror, or would you like to have a plush bench or chair in the closet? We will make that happen. We can also add pull-out drawers, slanted shoe racks, and so much more.
            </p>
            <p>

As an added bonus, your closet will be beautiful and well appointed; you will enjoy opening your closet door every day.
