You’re finally ready to banish clutter, take control of your bedroom area, and improve your quality of life - but do you really need a custom closet? Or does an armoire better suit your needs, or perhaps even a wardrobe, floating shelf system, or something else?

In this blog, our [custom closet contractors in Washington DC](https://myclosetguys.com/washington-dc-custom-closets/) discuss the differences between closets and armoires, along with key differences that may influence your decision. If you live in Maryland or Northern Virginia and have any questions, please get in touch.

## The Benefits of Closets Vs. Armoires

### The Benefits of a Custom Closet System

Custom closets are designed to fit the specific dimensions and storage needs of your space, as well as provide a cohesive look for your home. One of the main advantages of a custom closet is the maximization of storage. Unlike prefabricated solutions, custom systems can be tailored to include a variety of storage components, such as hanging rods, drawers, shelves, and custom shoe racks, all designed to accommodate your unique wardrobe and lifestyle. This customization extends to aesthetics as well; materials, finishes, and hardware can all be selected to complement your home’s decor.

Another significant benefit is the efficient use of space. Custom closets can be designed to utilize every inch of the available space, including awkward corners or high ceilings, ensuring that no area is wasted. This is particularly beneficial in smaller homes or apartments where maximizing space is crucial. Additionally, [custom closets can add value to your home](https://myclosetguys.com/blog/do-custom-closets-increase-the-value-of-your-home/). A well-designed, high-quality closet system is an attractive feature for potential buyers and can increase your home’s marketability and resale value.

In a nutshell, custom closets are fully designed for you. Do you have a lot of suits? Do you have dozens of pairs of shoes? Do you want a mirror and bench for dressing in the morning? They can all be included in your custom closet system.

### The Benefits of an Armoire

Armoires, on the other hand, offer a different set of advantages. For starters, they are a standalone piece of furniture that can add character and charm to a room. They come in a wide range of styles, from antique to modern, and can serve as a statement piece that enhances the room or suite. Armoires are also versatile; they can be moved from one room to another or taken with you if you move to a new home, offering a flexible storage solution that custom closets cannot. 

The installation process is another area where armoires shine. Unlike custom closets, which require professional installation, armoires are ready to use upon delivery. This can be a significant advantage for those who need an immediate storage solution or wish to avoid the disruption of a home improvement project. Moreover, armoires can be a more budget-friendly option, especially for renters or individuals who may not stay in their current home long-term.

While a custom closet can improve your home’s value, making customizations can add some risk when trying to sell. An armoire goes with you when you leave, and the lack of a permanent fixture removes that risk.

### Differences Between Closets and Armoires

The most apparent difference between custom closets and armoires is their permanence and integration within a space. Custom closets are built into the home, offering a cohesive look that feels like a part of the room’s architecture. Armoires, while flexible and stylish, are furniture pieces that occupy floor space, which may not be ideal for smaller rooms.

In terms of storage capacity and customization, custom closets generally offer more space and can be designed to fit an exact set of requirements. Armoires provide a fixed amount of space and limited customization options, which may not meet everyone's storage needs. Additionally, custom closets can be equipped with lighting, mirrors, and other accessories to enhance functionality and convenience, features that are not typically found in armoires.

## Other Considerations When Choosing Between an Armoire and Closet

When deciding between a custom closet and an armoire, consider your long-term needs and preferences. If you're settled in your home and looking for a durable solution that maximizes space and storage, a custom closet might be the way to go. However, if you're renting, planning to move soon, or simply prefer the flexibility and style of a standalone piece, an armoire could be the perfect choice.

It's also worth considering the impact on your daily routine. A well-organized custom closet can streamline your morning routine by making it easier to find what you're looking for. On the flip side, an armoire can serve multiple purposes, such as concealing a TV in the bedroom or doubling as a linen closet, offering functionality beyond clothing storage.

#### In Summary: Closets Are Permanent, Armoires Don’t Have To Be

If you’re planning to move, you may not want to build out a custom closet. It can add value to your home, but the hassle and cost may not be worth it. An armoire is likely a better choice for you. But if you’re going to stay put for a while, get a [custom closet in Maryland](https://myclosetguys.com/maryland-custom-closets). It can meet your very specific needs, dramatically improve your quality of life, and get rid of clutter while also making your morning routine more enjoyable.
