Refacing your cabinets can be an incredible way to transform your kitchen without the hassle of a full remodel. You can select the perfect paint color, choose unique door styles, and even hand-pick your hardware. In this blog, we’ll discuss the benefits of refacing cabinets, when a fully customized closet system might work better for you, and more. If you need help with [custom cabinets in Arlington](https://myclosetguys.com/arlington-cabinet-maker/) or elsewhere in the Greater DC area, get in touch!

## Pick the Perfect Paint or Stain

Paint and stain colors define the mood of your kitchen. With refacing, you’re free to choose shades that suit your style. For a bright and open look, light colors like white, soft gray, or beige make a great choice. They reflect natural light and can help make smaller kitchens feel bigger.

Darker colors like navy, charcoal, or forest green add depth. They’re bold and sophisticated, especially when paired with the right hardware. Darker tones also complement modern and industrial styles.

Stains are another option, especially if you love the natural look of wood. Light stains on oak or maple give a fresh, organic feel, while darker walnut or cherry stains bring a sense of richness. These options allow the wood’s grain to show through, adding texture and warmth that paint doesn’t.

## Veneers are the Foundation of Your New Look

Veneers form the outer layer that covers your cabinet frames and doors, setting the stage for your kitchen’s new style. Wood veneers are popular because they bring a natural look with visible wood grain, ideal for kitchens that need a classic touch. Oak, cherry, and maple veneers each have a unique grain pattern, allowing for a variety of looks within a single material.

Laminates and other synthetic veneers give you options outside of wood tones. Matte and glossy laminates come in various colors and finishes, so you can get creative. Some homeowners opt for laminates that mimic materials like concrete or even fabric textures, adding an unexpected layer of interest.

## You Can Change Your Door Style

The style of your cabinet doors plays a big role in the kitchen’s overall look. Shaker doors are a popular choice for their clean, straightforward design. With a simple frame around the panel, shaker doors fit well in both traditional and contemporary kitchens. They keep things streamlined while still adding structure to the cabinets.

Flat-panel doors bring a modern edge. Their smooth surface, with no raised edges or detailing, gives a minimalist look that works well in open, airy kitchens. If you’re drawn to simplicity, flat-panel doors create a seamless backdrop for bolder choices in color or hardware.

For a classic option, raised-panel doors add depth with a central panel that’s slightly raised above the frame. This style adds detail without overwhelming the space, and it works well with more traditional kitchen designs. Glass-front doors are another option, adding both light and function. They allow you to showcase special dishes or keep everyday items visible, adding a sense of openness without needing open shelving.

## Hardware Completes the Look

Hardware choices make a big difference in both style and function. Handles and knobs come in a range of finishes and shapes that help pull your whole look together. Sleek bar pulls in matte black, stainless steel, or brushed nickel fit well in modern kitchens. Their linear look adds a touch of sophistication without feeling heavy.

In more traditional kitchens, brass or bronze knobs and handles add warmth and character. A polished brass finish works well with natural wood tones, creating a look that feels both timeless and inviting. If you want something unique, mixed metals add a fun twist. You could choose matte black handles with brass hinges, bringing a playful contrast.

Shape matters, too. Bar pulls work best with drawers, giving you an easy grip, while round knobs feel right on cabinet doors. Cup pulls, which have a half-moon shape, provide a more vintage feel, especially when combined with a darker finish.

## Functional Upgrades for Everyday Convenience

In addition to giving cabinets a fresh look, refacing offers options to improve functionality. Many homeowners add soft-close hinges and drawer glides, which eliminate the clanging sound of closing cabinets and help prevent wear. Soft-close features also make cabinets feel more polished and durable, making them a worthwhile upgrade.

Pull-out shelves improve storage and accessibility, especially in deeper cabinets. They let you reach items at the back without having to rearrange everything in front. Lazy Susans in corner cabinets add similar benefits, providing rotating shelves that keep all your items within easy reach.
