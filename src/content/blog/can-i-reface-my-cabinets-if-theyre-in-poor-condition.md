imageAlt: Can you reface damaged cabinets?
---
If your kitchen cabinets are starting to show their age, you might wonder if cabinet refacing is still an option. After all, refacing is an appealing alternative to a full replacement. It’s faster, more affordable, and gives you the freedom to change up the look of your kitchen without the mess of a total overhaul. But when cabinets have seen better days, can refacing really make a difference, or is it time to replace them altogether? Here’s a look at how to tell if your cabinets are suitable for refacing, or if replacement might be the better option for your space.

If your cabinets need an update, call My Closet Guys. We specialize in [custom cabinets in Washington DC](https://myclosetguys.com/washington-dc-cabinet-maker/) and throughout Maryland, and we would be happy to speak with you. You can even get a free design consultation, and we send our customers a 3D virtual mockup of the cabinets before we start building.

## Can You Reface Damaged Kitchen Cabinets?

Yes, you can reface kitchen cabinets as long as the frames are still structurally sound. That’s the short answer. But there are many other issues at play. They may be so damaged that it’s simply cheaper to get new cabinets, or perhaps water damage or warping requires too many nickel-and-dime board replacements to make the project worthwhile. An expert can help you choose.

## Are the Frames Structurally Sound?

Cabinet refacing works by giving the exterior of your cabinets a facelift. In other words, it doesn’t touch the inside framework. For refacing to work, your cabinets need to have a strong, stable frame. Think of the frame as the backbone of the cabinet. If it’s warped, cracked, or compromised in any way, then the new doors, veneers, and drawer fronts won’t stay aligned properly, and you may end up with an uneven or unstable finish.

A quick check of the frames can help you determine if refacing is possible. Open the cabinets and examine the frame itself for signs of damage. Look for areas where the wood might be sagging or where there might be damage from water exposure. If you notice anything concerning, that doesn’t necessarily rule out refacing. Many minor frame issues can be repaired before the refacing process begins, allowing you to reface without replacing everything. However, significant structural problems could indicate that it’s time for a full replacement.

## How Much Damage is Too Much Damage?

Many cabinets can be brought back to life with a little TLC, but some damage may be too much for refacing alone to fix. Cosmetic issues, like scratches, minor dents, or small areas of worn finish, are all things that refacing can cover up beautifully. With new veneers and fresh doors, cabinets can look brand new even if they’re starting with a few scrapes and scuffs.

Water damage is often a bit trickier. If water has made the wood swell or warp, it could create a poor foundation for the new finish. Mold or rot can also be difficult to address, especially if it has spread deeply into the frame. In cases like these, a professional opinion can help. Cabinet experts can assess the extent of the damage and tell you if it’s something that refacing can fix or if it requires a bit more repair work before moving forward.

Additionally, look for signs of loose hinges, broken shelves, or other functional problems. These issues may seem small, but they can affect the cabinet’s ability to handle refacing materials. Hardware and small structural components can usually be replaced, so if your cabinets are just a little off-kilter, they may still be refaced. But for cabinets with broken parts or frames that are falling apart, replacement might be the better investment.

## When is it Simply Worth Replacing the Cabinets?

Refacing gives your cabinets a fresh look and can add years to their life, but there are cases when replacement is simply the better option. If you’re dealing with extensive damage, or if the layout of your cabinets no longer works for you, then it may make sense to explore a replacement.

### The Cabinet Layout No Longer Works For You

One situation where replacement becomes worthwhile is if the cabinet layout no longer fits your needs. For example, if your kitchen feels cramped or the cabinets don’t maximize space, a complete overhaul might be the best solution. Refacing is limited to the existing structure and layout, so if you’re dreaming of customizations, storage upgrades, or layout changes, replacement can give you the freedom to reimagine your kitchen from scratch.

### Structural and Water Damage

Another time replacement is worth considering is if your cabinets have serious structural or water damage. Cabinets that are warped, rotting, or affected by mold or pests often require extensive repair work that can be as costly as replacement. In these cases, investing in brand new cabinets will likely save you time and offer better durability in the long run. Additionally, if your cabinets are more than a few decades old, replacement could be a smart choice. Older cabinets may not have the durability or structural integrity of modern cabinets, making refacing less effective in the long term.

### Need Custom Features?

Replacement is also a good option if you’re looking to add custom features like pull-out shelves, soft-close doors, or other functionality upgrades that might not fit with your current cabinet structure. While refacing can refresh the look, replacement lets you redesign your kitchen exactly as you want it, down to the last detail.

## Every Kitchen is Different

Refacing is an incredible option when the basic structure of your cabinets is still intact. It gives you the opportunity to change the style and finish without the hassle of a full remodel. However, there are cases where replacement is simply the smarter investment, particularly when damage is extensive or functionality is lacking.

If you’re uncertain about the condition of your cabinets, getting an expert opinion can help you decide. Professional installers, like My Closet Guys in southern Maryland and the DC area, can assess the state of your cabinets and advise you on the best path forward. In some cases, a combination of minor repairs and refacing is all that’s needed to give your kitchen a fresh, modern look. In others, replacement may be the way to go.

Whether you decide to reface or replace, a refreshed kitchen is always worth the investment. With a little guidance and the right approach, you can achieve a space that feels brand new, functional, and designed to match your style.
