## Custom Pantry Ideas For Your Home

### Adjustable Shelving

Whether you're storing tall cereal boxes or small spice jars, adjustable shelves ensure that no space goes to waste. Your pantry installer can add different brackets to the side of your pantry, allowing you to easily remove shelves and make the space taller or shorter – this allows you to adapt the space to accommodate items of various sizes and shapes.

### Pull-Out Baskets and Bins

Maximizing the use of vertical space can make your pantry more efficient. Consider installing pull-out baskets and bins that can be easily accessed, even if they're placed on higher shelves. These custom pantry additions are ideal for storing snacks, vegetables, or even baking supplies. A skilled contractor can install flat pull-out shelving, enclosed pullout boxes, and even include quiet-close hardware so that your shelves don’t slam shut when you push them.

### Clear & Labeled Storage Containers

Choose clear, airtight containers for items like pasta, rice, flour, and sugar. Not only do they keep your food fresh for longer, but they also make it easy to see the contents at a glance. Additionally, labeling these containers can help you quickly identify and grab what you need while cooking. Keep pests and insects away from your grains with airtight containers, whether they are built into the pantry or included on a pull-out shelf.

### Add a Lazy Susan To Your Pantry

Lazy Susans are a brilliant addition to a custom pantry, especially for items that tend to get lost in the back of shelves. These rotating trays are perfect for condiments, oils, vinegars, and other small items. With a simple spin, you can access all your ingredients without having to rearrange the pantry constantly.

### Deep Drawer Pull-Outs

Consider adding deep drawer pull-outs to your custom pantry design. These pull-out drawers provide a fantastic solution for storing pots, pans, and even small kitchen appliances that you don't use daily. The depth allows for easy access, and it's a great way to keep your cookware organized and off your countertop, freeing up valuable workspace.

### Adjustable Door Racks

Don't forget to utilize the back of your pantry door. Adjustable door racks are an excellent space-saving feature that can hold a variety of items, from spices and sauces to kitchen towels and cleaning supplies. These racks can be customized to fit your specific needs and make the most of your pantry's vertical space.

### Wine and Beverage Station

If you're a wine enthusiast or enjoy having a well-stocked beverage selection, consider dedicating a section of your custom pantry to create a wine and beverage station. Install [custom wine racks](https://myclosetguys.com/washington-wine-storage), wine glass holders, and even include a small refrigerator for chilled beverages. It's a convenient way to keep your favorite drinks organized and easily accessible.

### Snack Station

For families with kids or those who love snacks, a designated snack station within your pantry can be a lifesaver. Use pull-out bins or baskets to store an assortment of snacks, such as granola bars, chips, and nuts. This keeps these items separate from your cooking ingredients, making it easier for everyone to grab a quick snack without disturbing the pantry's organization.

### Custom Spice Rack

A custom spice rack can speed up the cooking process more than you think. Arrange your spices alphabetically or by type for quick identification - and space them out so you can actually see the difference between cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and others without having to remove each McCormick jar.

### Task Lighting

Good lighting is often overlooked in pantry design. Adding task lighting to your custom pantry can make a significant difference in finding what you need quickly. Under-cabinet lighting or motion-sensor lights can illuminate your pantry shelves, making it easier to read labels and locate items. We often work with local electricians to include cutouts for wiring and light bulbs when we build custom pantry solutions.

## Custom Pantry Ideas For a Luxurious Walk-In Pantry

If you have the square footage and budget, you can create a magnificent walk-in pantry out of an existing section of your kitchen, or an extra closet space.

Elements like glass-fronted cabinets can add elegance, allowing you to display your most beautiful dishware or specialty food items. Integrating a central island within the pantry can provide additional workspace and storage, perfect for meal prep or as a coffee station.

For an upscale feel, consider using high-quality materials like marble countertops and brass or copper hardware. Ambient lighting, like soft LED strips or chic pendant lights, can enhance the atmosphere while providing ample illumination. Including a cozy seating area with a small table and chairs can transform your pantry into a relaxing spot for morning coffee or a quiet reading nook. For a truly personalized touch, incorporate artwork or decorative items that reflect your style. Finally, smart storage solutions like hidden compartments or built-in organizers for table linens and serving utensils can keep everything neatly in place while adding a luxurious and tailored feel to your walk-in pantry.

You can also allow the door to be the cherry on top of your custom pantry. Add a sliding barn door for a rustic look, or a fun hinged door with a large window to create a “general store feel.” You may even want a custom door with a foot opener so that you can carry all of the items you need in one trip!
